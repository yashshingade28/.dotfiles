# .dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for configuring Linux environments. These dotfiles are tailored to my personal preferences and workflows, but you are free to use them as a starting point for your own configuration.

## Prerequisites
To use these dotfiles, you must have the following software installed on your Linux system:
- Git
- [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (optional, but recommended)

## Installation
To install my dotfiles, follow these steps:
1) Clone this repository by entering the following command:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yashshingade28/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```
This will download the dotfiles repository into a new directory named .dotfiles in your home directory.

## Setup
Now that you have my dotfiles placed in the correct folder you can configure the various tools i use by following these commands.

Run the following command to setup my fonts for the current user.

```bash

```
Note: Please note that this command will load all the fonts present in the ~/.local/share/fonts directory for the current user, but it will not automatically set any font as the default. You will need to manually set your desired font in your system settings or in your application's font preferences.
