# .dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for configuring Linux environments. These dotfiles are tailored to my personal preferences and workflows, but you are free to use them as a starting point for your own configuration.

## Installation
Install my dotfiles by cloning this repository in your home directory by running the following command.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yashshingade28/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```
This command will download this dotfiles repository into a new directory named .dotfiles in your home directory.

  <summary>sparse-clone</summary>
  
In case you want to only clone some folders/files from my .dotfiles run the following command.
```bash
git clone --no-checkout --depth=1 --filter=blob:none https://github.com/yashshingade28/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```
Now you can sparse-checkout all the files and folders you want.
Here is a command for example which you can run inside the .dotfiles folder to clone only setup.sh and sublime-setup folder from my .dotfiles.
```bash
git sparse-checkout set --no-cone sublime-setup /setup.sh ; git checkout
```

## Setup
Now that you have my dotfiles placed in the correct folder, you can configure the various tools I use by following these commands. 

I have created a bash script that allows you to set up any of the following tools using just a single command. This script basically creates symbolic links to the necessary configuration files for each tool and backups any previous configuration files that may exist.

  <summary>fonts</summary>
Run the following command to setup my fonts for the current user.

```bash
bash ~/.dotfiles/setup.sh fonts
```
Note: Please note that this command will load all the fonts present in the `~/.local/share/fonts` directory for the current user, but it will not automatically set any font as the default. You will need to manually set your desired font in your system settings or in your application's font preferences.

Run the following command to setup my neovim config for the current user.

```
Note: I use [nvchad](https://nvchad.com) as my base neovim config, this script will download that for you along with backing up your old config and then link my nvchad custom folder to the base config.
